# Learning Experience Readme

## Introduction:

This is the Swiftcard E-commerce website . 

## Project Overview

- **Objective**: 

This Project is aimed to make sure that i'm very familiar with Alpine as one of Javascript frameworks,since its very easy to use and its lightweight compared to most js frameworks.
 

- **Technologies Used**: 

JavaScript (ES6), Alpine, HTML5, Tailwind , StackOverflow

## Learning Experience

### Challenges Faced

1. **Converting React to Alpine**: 

Had a very Difficult time trying to use React components in Alpine. I encountered some confusions of where i should make a component and not to incluede one.
   
2. **Using Api file inside Alpine**:

It was very difficult to import my fetched data from a different file inside html file. i was getting alot of errors trying to do that.

### Solutions Found

1. **Converting React to Alpine**: 

I took time studying the whole React code and i broke it down to first deal with small things. I firstly started creating Navbar in my HTML then made a main section for the products . Then created a modal for the clicked item.

2. **Using Api file inside Alpine**: 

I came with a plan to create a api file that will contain all my functions that i will need to use in the HTML, inside that file i made an empty object that will contain all the method i will need to use in the Alpine , i used the funct by calling it as x-data and used x-init="getData()" so that i can use all the fetched data 


2. **Problem-Solving Skills**: 

It was not easy to make this Project but i enforced my brain to build a very though muscle memory to try and understand while approaching the task in the Project, I tried to break down each task like a pazzle and i assebled it back together .

## Conclusion

It was a very exciting activity ,i encountered so many Problem but in most cases i made sure that i understand what i was doing even when i was getting some errors there and there i made sure i tackle them. I learned alot from this Project the difference with Alpine since it does not use any state Like React, Its very straight forward
